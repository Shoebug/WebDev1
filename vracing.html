            <p>A recent passion of mine is Virtual Racing Simulation. Racing Simulators, like "iRacing", offer very
                relistic comparison to real life racing, which is only further improved by hardware, like wheels,
                pedals, full simulator setups.
                <br>
                Ive been upgrading my own hardware and gear to get a more immersive expierence as it is truely enjoyable
                for me. On the right is my personal setup for Sim Racing.
                <br><br>
                I got into motorsport over covid and have slowly been getting deeper and deeper into the culture. I
                would love to attend an F1 race and its also my dream to drive an F4 car some day in some fasion.
