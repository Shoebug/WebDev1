        <p>Welcome to the Halloween Event guide. Below is a detailed guide on how to complete this event. However, if

            <p>Players must start by receiving a treat cauldron from the costumed children outside the Varrock west
                bank. The overall goal of the event is to collect treats by trick-or-treating around the kingdoms of
                Misthalin and Asgarnia.
                <br><br>
                Players can claim the Halloween rewards from previous years by speaking to the costumed children;
                players will need to wear three of said items to go trick-or-treating.
                <br><br>
                It is recommended to begin by trick-or-treating the following NPCs, each of whom gives a one-time reward
                of 100 treats:
            <form>
                <input type="checkbox">Ned in Draynor Village
                <br>
                <input type="checkbox">Elsie in Varrock
                <br>
                <input type="checkbox">Iffie in Varrock
                <br>
                <input type="checkbox">Town Crier in Falador
                <br>
                <input type="checkbox">Lumbridge Guide in Lumbridge
            </form>
            <br>
            Players can gain additional treats in multiple ways:
            <ul>
                <li>Using the trick-or-treat option on various NPCs around Gielinor (men, women, and guards). They will
                    either give 3-5 treats, or trick the player, in which the following may occur:</li>
                <ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>Players are transformed into a spider, rat, bat, or costumed stray dog for a few seconds;
                        players cannot control their character during this time. Having Protect from Magic active will
                        prevent players from being transformed 85% of the time.</li>
                    <li>Players may receive a smelly sock, spooky egg, bruised banana, or an old wool. These can be
                        combined into a terrifying charm, an ammo slot item that guarantees five treats for three uses.
                    </li>
                    <li>Alternatively, a ghost may appear. Using a ghostspeak amulet to converse with the ghost will
                        guarantee 5 treats for the next trick-or-treat as the player is temporarily granted a "ghostly
                        presence".</li>
                    <li>The most recent 3 NPCs will ask to trick-or-treat other NPCs first before doing it on them.</li>
                    <br>
                </ul>
                <li>Finding a Generous Treater, who gives 100 treats. Continuously logging out and back in will let you
                    trick endlessly. Their locations are constantly changing, but are only in Varrock. The easiest way
                    to find them is to hop worlds on one of the known spawn spots.</li>
                <li>Mining (including crashed stars, but excluding Motherlode Mine), Woodcutting, and Fishing. </li>
            </ul>

                <li>Cobweb cape</li>
