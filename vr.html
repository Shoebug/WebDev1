            <p>I named Virtual Reality here because over summer my friend was kind enough gift me his Orginal HTC Vive.
                <br>
                I only messed around with VR a tiny bit prior to this, but the expierence is very good and it might be a
                field I would want to enter in the tech industry in the future. Although its very early days with my
                expierence with VR.
                <br>
                I have played a few games like Beat Saber which is a fully body rhythm game, think DDR but with your
                hands, and things like Half-life:Alyx, which if the future of VR goes that direction I will be 100% a
                subscriber of this technology.
