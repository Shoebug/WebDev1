        <p>Welcome to the Christmas Event guide. Below is a detailed guide on how to complete this event. However, if
            you
            would like the quick guide then click <a href="./christmassteps.html">here. </a></p>

                Talk to Jack Frost, who will explain that he wanted to use the cow pen for a fun event. Unfortunately,
                the cows could not stay up on the ice. He will send you in instead, and task you with several "Christmas
                Achievements."
                <br><br>
                After speaking to Jack, follow the beacons to complete I love you. You will be able to move around the
                pen by sliding on the ice; aim for the snow piles in order to have a place to stop and head in a new
                direction. You can slide diagonally by clicking a single tile in the direction you would like to skate.
                After completing the first achievement, return to Jack.
                <br><br>
                This time, it's time to jump the ramp. Head back into the pen and follow the beacon again to cross the
                ramp; turn around and jump over it again to complete Jumping the shark. Return to Jack.
                <br><br>
                Anti-Santa will appear and disrupt the event. Jack will tell Anti-Santa that the event is actually
                designed to teach the perils of life; Anti-Santa will enter the pen to see for himself. Once he's inside
                the pen, collect some snowballs, equip them, and enter the gate and pelt Anti-Santa. You will need to
                successfully hit Anti-Santa 10 times and click through the ensuing dialogue each time.[1] This can only
                be done while standing still, so try not to slide away after throwing a snowball. Successfully pelting
                someone scales with Ranged level, reaching a 100% success rate at level 70.
                <br><br>
                When he says "Ow! I get the idea, you can stop now," click through the dialogue, and Jack will claim
                he's going to make you denser. Finally, click on Anti-Santa to slide into him and knock him over,
                completing Say bye to the villain.
                <br><br>
                Jack will now ask you to pet the wild goose found east of him, outside the cow pen turned ice rink. Pet
                the goose, then return to Jack one final time.
                <br><br>
                Congratulations, event complete!
