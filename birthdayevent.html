        <p>Welcome to the Birthday Event guide. Below is a detailed guide on how to complete this event. However, if

            <p>Begin by talking to Patty Seer in the Lumbridge Castle kitchen. She will lament about how her lucky cake
                tin has broken, and how she now cannot bake a cake for the Great Gielinor Cake Off. Agree to help her.
                She will give you a cracked cake tin. The cook, overhearing this, suggests that Bob may know how to fix
                it. He mentions how Bob owes him a favour, and gives you a promissory note to cover the cost of repair.
                <br><br>
                Talk to Bob at Bob's Brilliant Axes to give him the cracked cake tin and the promissory note. He will
                fix the cake tin, giving you back a prized cake tin. Return back to Patty Seer with the prized cake tin
                and talk to her. She will thank you for getting the cake tin fixed, but will now mention that her lucky
                chef's hat was stolen by a goblin.
                <br>
                Talk to Warmhandz, found outside the Lumbridge General Store north of Lumbridge Castle. Warmhandz is an
                aspiring chef, who has watched people cook in the castle for the last 10 years, and wishes to cook as
                well. You suggest to Warmhandz that Patty could help them to become a chef. Warmhandz, accepting your
                suggestion, quickly runs off towards the castle. Return to Lumbridge Castle and speak to Patty Seer
                again. After learning of Warmhandz's desire to become a chef, Patty lets the goblin keep her chef's hat.
                The two then begin conversing about baking a cake for the Cake Off. After some time, the two manage to
                successfully bake a cake. Patty asks you to submit this special cake to the Cake Off, which needs to be
                delivered to Party Pete in Falador. She will then offer you a teleport to the Falador Party Room.
                <br><br>
                At the Falador Party Room, talk to Party Pete. You will hand the cake over to him. He will ask you to
                speak to Archmage Sedridor in the party room with you. Sedridor is having a problem with the everlasting
                candle on the birthday cake; he cannot light it no matter what he has tried. The only method he has not
                tried involves dragonfire, however finding a dragon to light the candle would take too much time.
                Dejected, Sedridor redirects you back to Party Pete.
                <br><br>
                Talk to Party Pete again. After mentioning dragonfire, Pete says he sent out an invitation to the dragon
                Elvarg, however he has not heard a response back from her. Party Pete will ask you to check all of the
                cakes in order to ensure they are ready for judging. If you have not done so already, check the gnome
                cake, the Varrock cake, the goblin cake, and the dwarf cake. Talk to Party Pete again when you've
                checked all the cakes.
                <br><bR>
                A cutscene will play, showing Party Pete trying Thurgo's Imcando Dwarf Cake (in reality a redberry pie)
                and General Bentnoze and Wartface's goblin cake (a cake covered in mud). The Great Gielinor Cake Off is
                cut short, however, when Elvarg (or Alvarg if the player has completed Dragon Slayer I) shows up!
                <br>
                When the cutscene concludes, speak to Party Pete again. He was hoping Elvarg/Alvarg would bring a cake,
                however their presence has at least managed to light the everlasting candle. Since the Varrock cake was
                burnt, and the gnome cake was not a cake, but rather cookies, the Lumbridge cake wins!
                <br><br>
                Speak to Warmhandz (who is now in the party room with you) to tell them they've won, and are now one of
                the best chefs in Gielinor.
                <br><br>
                To finish the event speak to Party Pete. Once finished going through the dialogue you will receive your
                rewards.
                <br><br>
                If you wish, you may now speak with Sir Pear Visor in the Old School Museum in the party room basement
                to enable extra drops around the world to help complete the new exhibits in the museum.
