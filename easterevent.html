        <p>Welcome to the Easter Event guide. Below is a detailed guide on how to complete this event. However, if you
            would like the quick guide then click <a href="./eastersteps.html">here. </a></p>

            <p>
                Talk to the Easter Bunny just east of Varrock's west bank. He will tell you that his easter egg mould
                has gone missing, believing that children have picked it up. The player will believe it to be Gertrude's
                children, and he will ask that you speak to her to find out. Agree to help him.
                <br><br>
                Head west and speak to Gertrude, who will tell you that she does not know whether they took the egg
                mould or not, but believes they might given that she was unable to afford Easter eggs for her children
                last year due to fewer people buying kittens. She then tells you where her children are and tells you to
                speak to them.
                <br><br>
                Philop and Kanel are in their own rooms in the house. Philop will tell you that he was playing with
                Charlie the Tramp after his brothers ran off, whilst Kanel will give you information in exchange for
                helping him with his homework, which is to decipher the numbers "8 1 16 16 25 | 5 1 19 20 5 18". These
                represent the letters of the alphabet, and spells out "HAPPY EASTER"; include the space when prompted to
                input the answer. He will then tell you that whilst eating dinner, he overheard Wilough and Shilop
                talking about "a colourful spade".
                <br><br>
                Shilop and Wilough can be found in Varrock Square, by the market stalls where Baraek and Benny are
                found. Shilop will offer you a hint to the mould's location in exchange for an Easter egg, and will ask
                for the solution to the anagram "andri", to which the answer is "drain".
                <br><br>
                Wilough will give you a hint if you can beat him in a game of "Egg, Silk, Secateurs"; agree to play, and
                a cutscene will ensue. However, no matter what you choose, you will always lose because Wilough cheats
                at the game by making up reasons as to why his hand wins. Seeing you lose, Horvik asks that you come to
                his shop and speak to him.
                <br><br>
                Horvik will tell you that Wilough plays the game with different people every day and cheats every time.
                Wishing to teach him a lesson, he will give you a giant bronze dagger, which he received as a gift from
                an old friend, to use against him - metaphorically. Return to Wilough and ask to play again. This time,
                you will take out the oversized dagger and use his own cheats against him, claiming that the dagger
                beats the egg, silk, and secateurs. He will relent and tell you that he hid the egg near "the pub".
                <br><br>
                Once you've dealt with all four children, return to the Easter Bunny, who will give you an Eastfloor
                spade. Head to the east side of the Blue Moon Inn (Pub icon.png icon), and dig on the tile to the east
                of the drain to retrieve the egg mould. Return to the Easter Bunny, and he'll ask you to help make sure
                the mould works. Right-click "Get-ingredients" to obtain a bucket of freezing milk and Easter chocolate
                dust. Repeat this until you have ten dust.
                <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Dust the egg mould with Easter chocolate dust to obtain a dusted egg mould.</li><br>
                <li>Use the dusted mould on a fire/range to obtain a hot egg mould. This will provide 1 Cooking
                    experience.</li><br>
                <li>Empty the hot mould to obtain an Easter egg half. Make another one.</li><br>
                <li>Combine two halves to obtain a warm easter egg.</li><br>
                <li>Use the warm easter egg on the bucket of freezing milk to obtain an Easter egg. Make four more.</li>
                <br>
            </ol>
            After making five Easter eggs, talk to the Easter Bunny, who will tell you that you can keep the eggs. Give
            these to Gertrude, who will thank you. Lastly, return to the Easter Bunny to complete the event.
